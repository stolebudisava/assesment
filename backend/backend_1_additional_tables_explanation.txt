I've created few new tables based on mine experience on websites
where you can by something, like :

-cart, for orders you're considering to buy

-payment_card, so you could enter multiple cards and choose with which to buy,
and allow system to remember them so you don't have to enter all numbers over and over again

-billing and shipping address, maybe customer would have few shipping and billing addresses so i thought
it will be useful to have tables that represent them as well 

-survey, newsletter, emails - i saw on 2nd task there are couple of methods about them,
so i assumed they are needed
